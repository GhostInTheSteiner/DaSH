# DaSH - The "Super Hacker"
This is a repository of the current version of...

https://github.com/GhostInTheSteiner/Daru

...which contains *very* old code, and also has been remade and later on hosted on another server by Emojikage ("RIP95" on GitHub):

https://github.com/RIP95/daru-bot

Since I started hosting the bot on my Banana Pi myself and Emojikage stopped maintaining/developping the bot, I decided to open my own GitHub for the current version of DaSH ("Daru the Supah Haka", the new "old" name of Daru).
